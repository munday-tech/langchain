    "# Using HTMLSemanticPreservingSplitter for Structured HTML Splitting\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The `HTMLSemanticPreservingSplitter` is designed to split HTML content into manageable chunks while preserving the semantic structure of important elements like tables, lists, and other HTML components. This ensures that such elements are not split across chunks, causing loss of contextual relevancy such as table headers, list headers etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This splitter is designed at its heart, to create contextually relevant chunks. General Recursive splitting with `HTMLHeaderTextSplitter` can cause tables, lists and other structered elements to be split in the middle, losing signifcant context and creating bad chunks. \n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: `max_chunk_size` is not a definite maximum size of a chunk, the calculation of max size, occurs when the preserved content is not apart of the chunk, to ensure it is not split. When we add the preserved data back in to the chunk, there is a chance the chunk size will exceed the `max_chunk_size`. This is crucial to ensure we maintain the structure of the original document"

    "In this example, we will demonstrate how the `HTMLSemanticPreservingSplitter` can preserve a table and a large list within an HTML document. The chunk size will be set to 50 characters to illustrate how the splitter ensures that these elements are not split, even when they exceed the maximum defined chunk size."
